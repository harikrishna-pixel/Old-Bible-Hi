    <h1>📖 Bible App – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🔧 Technical Issues</h2>
        <p><strong>1. I updated the app and lost all my bookmarks, highlights, and notes. What should I do?</strong><br>
        If you <strong>did not uninstall</strong> the app before updating, your data may still be stored locally.<br>
        ➡ Try restarting the app and checking the <strong>My Library</strong> section.<br>
        ➡ If you <strong>uninstalled</strong> the app, your data may be lost unless you previously <strong>signed in</strong> and enabled backup.</p>

        <p><strong>2. The Bible text is showing “Content is Empty.”</strong><br>
        This could be a temporary issue with loading.<br>
        ➡ Ensure a stable internet connection.<br>
        ➡ Try restarting the app.<br>
        ➡ If specific chapters or books fail to load, send us a screenshot and version details.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Why can’t I log in or reset my password?</strong><br>
        ➡ If you never created an account before, you must <strong>sign up first</strong>.<br>
        ➡ Your purchase is tied to your Apple ID, not an app account.<br>
        ➡ Login is only needed for backup and sync — not for restoring purchases.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Why does the app say “Invalid Token”?</strong><br>
        ➡ This may occur due to session timeout or app reinstallation. Try restarting the app.<br>
        ➡ If the issue persists, go to Settings and tap <strong>Logout → Login again</strong> or reinstall only if support suggests.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Why is the app still showing ads after I paid for the premium version?</strong><br>
        ➡ This issue was fixed in version <strong>1.0.55</strong>.<br>
        ➡ Update the app from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/new-living-translation-nlt/id6459818399">App Store</a>.<br>
        ➡ Then go to <strong>Settings → Restore Purchase</strong> if ads are still showing.</p>

        <p><strong>8. Can I use the premium version without creating an account?</strong><br>

        ➡ Your premium access is tied to your Apple ID, not to a Bible app account.<br>
        ➡ You can restore purchases without logging into the app.</p>

        <h2>☁️ Backup & Recovery</h2>

        ➡ Sign up or log in to the app<br>
        ➡ The app will automatically sync your <strong>My Library</strong> content to the cloud<br>
        ➡ You can then recover your data if you reinstall the app or switch devices.</p>

        <p><strong>10. How do I import or recover my saved data after reinstalling the app?</strong><br>
        ➡ Reinstall the app<br>
        ➡ Log in to your account<br>

        <p><strong>11. What should I do <em>before uninstalling</em> the app to avoid losing data?</strong><br>
        ➡ Take a backup!<br>
        ✔ Sign in to your account<br>

        <h2>🔄 Reading & Usage</h2>
        <p><strong>12. Why does a pop-up appear when I underline a verse?</strong><br>
        ➡ The pop-up is used to show a banner ad in a way that does not interrupt your reading flow.<br>
        ➡ We are exploring ways to reduce distractions in future versions.</p>

        <p><strong>13. Can I read and listen to the audio simultaneously?</strong><br>
